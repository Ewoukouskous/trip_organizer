## Next features

---

### Save system

I'd like in the future implements a file system in JSON by using **Jackson** 
or **GSON**. It'll permit to the user to not lose all their trips by just closing
the app

---

### Budget system

In the future I'd like to implement a future that'll permit to the user
to adjust his budget on the trip.
Like declare 200€ on activities or 700€ on transports. And some warnings when the 
cost is over the budget.

I also want to add the total budget of the trip in the end of the timeline for 
give more information to the user

--- 

### Travelers system

By using a multi account I'd like to implement an update on the travelers.

Like one of a group create a trip and invite his friends to add some activities or help
the trip creator to manage. The travelers can also join activities they want.
